“OF FOWLS AFTER their kind,” the Lord said to Noah, “and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the Earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee.” Co-operation from the animal kingdom helped make the biblical patriarch history’s greatest conservationist, saving every land-based animal, including humans, from a wave of divine extinction

The patriarch was able to fit a breeding pair of each of the 5.6m or so terrestrial species onto his 300 cubits-long ark.

===== translation2 =====

Which animals should a modern-day Noah put in his ark?.

The patriarch was able to fit a breeding pair of each of the 5.6m or so terrestrial species onto his 300 cubits-long ark.

Despite their poor reputation, vultures might therefore earn a place on a resource-constrained ark.

The selection for the ark should try to preserve as much of this information as possible, even if the animals themselves do not do much for human welfare.

That led to what some conservationists might consider a repugnant conclusion: counterintuintively, the best way to preserve biodiversity is for the resource-constrained ark to pick a single species and squeeze in as many as possible.

Noah might be best to fill the ark with resilient cockroaches instead, ensuring that at least one creature makes it through the flood.

Were Noah to have filled his ark with cockroaches—or pandas, for that matter—a single virus could have wiped out the lot.

species
species

The patriarch was able to fit a breeding pair of each of the 5.6m or so terrestrial species onto his 300 cubits-long ark.

A forthcoming paper by Eyal Frank of the University of Chicago and Anant Sudarshan of the University of Warwick looks at the economic benefits of “keystone species”.

That led to what some conservationists might consider a repugnant conclusion: counterintuintively, the best way to preserve biodiversity is for the resource-constrained ark to pick a single species and squeeze in as many as possible.

Trying to keep two species alive, and failing, means losing everything.

The real-world implication of this is that using conservation funds on highly endangered species risks throwing good money after bad.

Some scientists have suggested releasing genetically modified, sterilised versions of the insects that would get rid of the species altogether; others warn that doing so could have unforeseen consequences by eradicating both a pollinator and a food source for other animals.

Genetic range reduces the vulnerability of any individual part of an ecosystem to pests and diseases, helping avoid catastrophe if a species vital for human survival goes extinct.

biodiversity
biodiversity
===== translation5 =====

生物多样性 
>>>>> phrase 5 <<<<<
///// sentences 5 /////
Weitzman’s goal, beyond biblical interpretation, was to create an economic theory of conservation, calculating a strategy that a rational conservationist could follow to maximise both human welfare and natural biodiversity.

The second part of the calculation places a direct value on biodiversity.

Weitzman applies the same logic to animals: biodiversity has both an aesthetic value and an informational one, with content embedded in the genetics of animals.

That led to what some conservationists might consider a repugnant conclusion: counterintuintively, the best way to preserve biodiversity is for the resource-constrained ark to pick a single species and squeeze in as many as possible.

To reach that counterintuitive conclusion, Weitzman assumed that people ought to value biodiversity for its own sake.

Even when valuing animals solely on their benefits to humanity, biodiversity still has something to offer: insurance.

The same may be true of biodiversity.
