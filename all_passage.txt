### **National statistics, grilled**

# **The meaty mystery at the heart of China’s economic growth**

*What kebab consumption says about the country’s consumption*

May 11th 2023 | Zibo

![9b8fee4b-87b3-498b-993c-9896254ab668.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/18bdb7b8-ed78-4910-8272-e4b7d49d5b0e/9b8fee4b-87b3-498b-993c-9896254ab668.jpg)

OVER THE past few decades, the small, industrial city of Zibo has been best-known for its petrochemical output. In recent months, however, it has become the centre of a national barbecue craze and social-media phenomenon unlike anything China has seen before. Tourists have flooded the city in the central province of Shandong in the hope of munching its mythical kebabs, posting videos on Douyin, the local version of TikTok, and then departing. Arenas have been converted into makeshift dining halls in order to cope with the massed crowds. To ease constraints on the supplies of meat and grills, local banks have started handing out low-interest loans designed specifically for merchants in barbecue-related industries.

During the recent May Day holiday, one of the most important weeks of the year for domestic shopping and entertainment spending, the chemicals hub was listed as a top tourist destination alongside other popular places such as the Great Wall and the Terracotta Warriors. A widely shared internet meme jokes that the last time this many people showed up in the city was during the Siege of Qi, a famous battle that took place in the area in 284BC.

![d9f8d386-4229-454e-ad69-61eab27cd6cc.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/60c60cf0-b976-40a9-b7ab-f9b7f9202abc/d9f8d386-4229-454e-ad69-61eab27cd6cc.png)

This frenzied activity in Zibo should be helping China recover from its disastrous zero-covid era. Analysts have highlighted consumption as a bright spot in the Chinese economy this year amid a gloomier outlook for construction and manufacturing. Indeed, at first glance activity during the recent holiday appears to be strong. The resumption in tourism has been stunning. A record 274m people travelled, up 19% from before the pandemic. Just months ago, a short jaunt could land you in a quarantine camp for weeks.

Yet other data reveal a more modest recovery—only to levels last seen in 2019, before covid-19, and not beyond them. Although more people travelled this year, spending per head was down by more than 10% against 2019, according to HSBC, a bank. As a consequence, domestic tourism revenues were up by a mere 0.7% on four years ago. “Chinese consumers are not back to normal,” warns the boss of an asset-management firm. They are focused on food and fun, not big-ticket items like cars, he says. Auto sales were down 1.4% year on year in the first four months of 2023.

Young folk are going out of their way to spend less. Since the end of zero-covid, many tourists have described themselves as “special-ops” travellers. This alludes to dropping into a location, spending as little time and money as possible, and then moving on to the next spot—much as an elite military outfit might pass through a location unnoticed. The activity has become something of a sport, where young people visit a list of popular places and check them off by posting pictures on social media. Zibo’s kebabs have been one of the top items to tick off from the list.

It is not, though, just youthful frugality behind weak consumption figures. Urban disposable incomes barely grew, at least by Chinese standards, in the first three months of the year, up just 2.7% in real terms compared to the same period a year ago, notes Raymond Yeung of ANZ, a bank. A fifth of youngsters are now out of work, double the rate in April 2019, he adds.

Zibo kebabs are the perfect treat for a budget traveller. They are consumed at low tables with a small stove, heated by coal. When the fat starts to drip, the meat is scraped into a thin pancake and dipped first into a garlic and chilli paste and then into a salty mixture of sesame and peanut. A bottle of the city’s local beer, called Lulansha, comes to less than three yuan ($0.40). Four people can eat and drink for hours on less than 350 yuan. The craze is about more than the simple food. One barbecue purveyor who has operated a shop for several years in the city’s Linzi district points out that anyone can sell *chuan’r*, as the dish is called locally. It is Shandong’s big-hearted hospitality that people across the country are seeking out in Zibo.

Yet the cheap eats have stirred controversy among social commentators. Wu Xiaobo, a popular author, wrote recently that viral internet trends playing out on the streets of cities such as Zibo are evidence of a robust free-market economy at work in China. His article, however, generated such a backlash that it has been censored.

Others are less sanguine. One widely circulated article, by Liu Yadong, a professor, asserts that the trend is evidence of social decay in China, with young people fixated on online fads that hold little cultural value. Another article, by Wang Mingyuan, a think-tank researcher, suggests that the barbecue hype is a sign of the end of a decades-long economic cycle. The small cities where most of China’s population dwell have run out of more standard drivers of growth; the demographic dividend is running low, as the country’s population ages. Thus local officials must leap on whatever passing internet craze comes their way. How much longer, Mr Wang asks, can the barbecue party continue? ■

### **Credibility over confidence**

# **Interpreting China’s unambitious growth target**

### ***The government has played it safe with the economy—and its own reputation***

### **Mar 5th 2023 | HONG KONG**

![3951e30b-a65f-4374-bd26-ffa36621b21b.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c3fbad1f-5adf-4a6e-b9db-6887ec2e468c/3951e30b-a65f-4374-bd26-ffa36621b21b.jpg)

WHEN CHINA’S government sets its economic growth target for the year, it often faces a dilemma. A balance must be struck between inspiring confidence and maintaining credibility. A high target could give courage to entrepreneurs, making fast growth easier to achieve. But ambitious targets can also be missed, denting the government’s reputation. (They can also induce reckless stimulus spending to avert any such embarrassment.)

![1d3ad40f-98b5-4ba0-9b2e-8cd37d527110.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/50ad656b-0a16-4106-825c-46ed9d9ae9bc/1d3ad40f-98b5-4ba0-9b2e-8cd37d527110.png)

Last year the government missed its target by a wide margin (see chart), largely owing to its costly attempt to keep covid-19 at bay. This year it has prized credibility over confidence. On March 5th [Li Keqiang](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/03/02/chinas-prime-minister-li-keqiang-is-about-to-retire), China’s outgoing prime minister, opened the National People’s Congress, China’s rubber-stamp parliament, with his annual “work report”. It revealed a growth target of “around 5%” in 2023.

That may seem like a respectable pace, roughly in line with China’s underlying “trend” rate of growth. But the economy would normally be expected to exceed that trend comfortably this year, because it fell so far short of it last year. The target is lower than many external forecasts. Even if it is met, China’s GDP will remain more than 2% below the path it was supposedly on before the Omicron variant arrived last year.

The government reckons that China must create about 12m new urban jobs this year. This target is more demanding than last year’s (12m versus “over 11m”) even though the growth target is less so. The government may be hoping that China will enjoy an unusually “job-full” recovery, as labour-intensive service industries, like retail and catering, bounce back from the pandemic-era restrictions that hit them particularly hard. It also wants employment to keep pace with the record 11.58m students who are expected to graduate from universities and colleges in 2023.

The undemanding growth target removes any pressure to stimulate the economy further. Compared with last year, Mr Li’s report contained fewer exhortations to local governments to keep the economy going. He instead pointed out the need to prevent a build-up of new debts. “The budgetary imbalances of some local governments are substantial,” he noted. This year they will be allowed to issue 3.8trn-yuan ($550bn) worth of “special” bonds (which are supposed to finance revenue-generating infrastructure projects). On paper, that quota is a little higher than last year. But it may not feel like it in practice, because local-government spending last year was bolstered by an unusually large stash of bond proceeds carried over from 2021.

The report’s conservatism is in keeping with a theme of this year’s congress: China’s rulers tightening their grip over the state. President Xi Jinping’s new economic team will feature trusted aides and acolytes. Li Qiang, the party’s number two, is expected to replace Li Keqiang as prime minister. He Lifeng, who worked with Mr Xi in Fujian (and attended his second wedding), is likely to become a deputy prime minister in charge of economic policy. He may also serve as party chief of the central bank. If so, he will oversee a new governor of the bank, who is likely to be Zhu Hexin, a commercial banker who served as vice-governor of the province of Sichuan.

Mr Li’s report offered little guidance on what closer control would mean in practice. Like previous editions, the document is a combination of theological boilerplate (“hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics”), policy bromides (“we should enhance the intensity and effectiveness of our proactive fiscal policy”) and technocratic factoids (China increased the length of expressways by 30% and drainage pipelines by more than 40% over the past five years).

The most striking novelty in this year’s report was its nostalgia. Last year’s edition turned from past to present by the eighth page (of the English translation). This year Mr Li did not leave the past behind until the 31st page and then spared only four pages to discuss priorities for 2023. Perhaps he found it hard to talk about the future, given that he will have no role in shaping it. ■

### **Smell-O-Vision 2.0**

# **How to bring scents to the metaverse**

*VR enthusiasts turn their attentions to an evocative, but neglected, sense*

May 10th 2023 |

![418b9886-b197-4604-bd95-db434bc1575e.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4aee3c27-9c2b-49c2-8f98-2d3d720240cb/418b9886-b197-4604-bd95-db434bc1575e.jpg)

IT WAS one of those many inventions that never quite took off. In 1960, audiences watching the film “Scent of Mystery” got to experience the wonders of “Smell-O-Vision”. Mounted under the cinema seats, the system pumped out 30 different scents—from salty ocean breezes to whiffs of wine—at crucial moments in the plot. The system had its quirks. Those in the balcony complained that the smells reached them too late. Others found the scents to be too faint, or else irritatingly persistent. More novel than effective, Smell-O-Vision never really took root in Hollywood.

These days the cutting-edge of entertainment is video games and virtual reality, not films. Several groups are trying to bring scents to virtual worlds. In one paper published this week in *Nature Communications*, Xinge Yu at City University of Hong Kong and Yuhang Li at Beihang University describe two wearable “olfaction interfaces”. The first is the size of a plaster, and is affixed to the skin, like a fake moustache, under the user’s nose. The second, more capable version is a flexible face mask.

Both rely on heating tiny tiles of paraffin wax that have been impregnated with various liquid perfumes. The smaller version of the system uses two such tiles; the bigger one has nine. The researchers claim that they can generate a scent, such as mint or green tea, in as little as 1.44 seconds. The nine generators on the mask can combine to produce hundreds of possible odours.

Drs Li and Yu have been beaten to market by OVR, a startup based in Vermont. Its headset uses a system of refillable cartridges, each of which can make thousands of scents. The firm’s newest product, the “ION3”, will be released later this year, and can be tied into existing game-creation tools with minimal fuss.

Getting smells right could make virtual worlds more compelling. Odours are famously evocative. The part of the brain that processes them connects directly to parts associated with emotions and memory. But the science is tricky. Unlike colour or sound, where wavelengths and frequencies combine in predictable ways, smell is not so straightforward. Altering a single chemical bond can shift a scent from sweet to rancid. Whether smelly VR will do better than smelly films remains to be seen. But perhaps one day users will be able to stop, swipe and smell the virtual roses. ■

Too darn hot
How cities can respond to extreme heat
Officials from Beijing to Phoenix are grappling with unbearable temperatures
Jul 20th 2023 |

THE BEST thing that has happened in Phoenix, Arizona, since the beginning of July is that the electricity grid has kept functioning. This has meant that during a record-breaking run of daily maximum temperatures above 43°C (110°F), still in progress as The Economist went to press, the houses, indoor workplaces and publicly accessible “cooling stations” in the city have been air-conditioned. There have been deaths from heat stroke and there will be more; there has been a lot of suffering; and there will have been real economic losses. But if Arizona’s grid had gone out, according to an academic quoted in “The Heat Will Kill You First”, a new book, America would have seen “the Hurricane Katrina of extreme heat”.

It is not just the United States, where 100m people are under heat-advisory notices, that is suffering. There is currently a spate of such heatwaves around the world. Much of the Mediterranean is in similar straits, with temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F) from Madrid to Cairo (which is suffering power cuts). In Beijing July 18th saw a 23-year-old record broken by a 27th consecutive day with a maximum temperature above 35°C. By increasing the odds of a wide range of extreme events, global warming also increases the chances that they will come in waves.

Unbearable heat does damage in various ways, including killing crops and livestock, but the immediate challenge it poses to human health is greatest in cities. Less vegetation, more sunlight-absorbing tarmac and more waste heat produce what is called the urban-heat-island effect, exacerbating temperatures. Cities also often have poor air quality, particularly in the places where the poorest people live; extreme heat on top of dirty air can stretch already hard-pressed lungs and hearts too far.

There are things to do as soon as the mercury rises. Get homeless people to cooling stations; encourage people to look in on elderly neighbours and relatives (the old, especially women over 80, dominate the excess deaths associated with heatwaves); make it possible for those who must work outside to do so very early in the morning; put hospitals on an emergency footing. The appointment of chief heat officers empowered to co-ordinate such things in American cities, and farther afield, is a welcome trend.

There are also things to be done in advance. It is crucial to work out where the people at greatest risk live. One thing that can help is deciding where to plant trees, which both provide shade and, as water evaporates through their leaves, cool the air. (It is probably best to work out how to keep them green using wastewater, too, especially if, like the people of Phoenix, you live in a desert.) There are smart choices to be made about the built environment, from the best sort of pavement and courtyards designed for passive cooling to the prevalence of white roofs; there are building codes to update so as to make those choices easier, as well as regulations to change so that workers are not endangered by midday heat.

All these measures are easier to take when a city has resources to devote to them. In the developing world, where a lack of air conditioning makes heat all the more deadly, such resources are scarce. All the more need for leaders to take the issue seriously and for local politicians to see cooling plans as a way to compete for votes. Unfortunately, such a strategy works best in places where voters have already felt the consequences of failing to act. That makes studies which reveal that many places are at increasing risk of vicious heatwaves but have yet to experience one particularly troubling. Phoenix at least knows what to expect—and what it will have to go on expecting for decades to come.■

### **The last Founding Father**

# **Martin Luther King was among the greatest Americans—and the most misunderstood**

*Jonathan Eig’s magnificent new biography wrestles with him in all his complexity*

May 11th 2023 |

![d39cdc9f-29db-47e8-be68-ad9da177e4df.jpg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a8345c02-de94-467b-9b66-fd89bb0f871e/d39cdc9f-29db-47e8-be68-ad9da177e4df.jpg)

**King: A Life.** By Jonathan Eig. *Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 688 pages; $35. Simon & Schuster; £25*

SIX MONTHS after Florida’s board of education banned “[critical race theory](https://www.economist.com/interactive/united-states/2022/07/14/critical-race-theory-is-being-weaponised-whats-the-fuss-about)” (CRT)—in essence, the study of structural racism—from its classrooms, Ron DeSantis, the governor, introduced legislation further restricting what his state’s teachers could say about race. He invoked an unlikely ally: “You think about what MLK stood for,” he told a crowd last year. “He didn’t want people judged on the colour of their skin, but on the content of their character.” Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the House of Representatives, invoked King too: CRT, he said, “goes against everything Martin Luther King junior taught us—not to judge others by the colour of their skin.”

The phrase “content of their character”, which King used in his “I Have a Dream” speech, delivered at the March on Washington of 1963, has become one of his best known. Out of context, it seems to advocate colour-blindness towards individuals above all else, even to suggest that policies which take account of racial inequities are themselves unfairly biased. That is a misunderstanding of King’s views—and it is far from the only one in wide circulation. The reverence with which Americans of all political stripes view him today obscures how deeply divisive he was in his time.

King was a thorny, prophetic, demanding thinker. He struggled to balance his optimistic patriotism against self-doubt and, later in his life, against his creeping pessimism about America’s ability to overcome its demons. Jonathan Eig’s magnificent new biography is an overdue attempt to grapple with King in all his complexity.

His book will inevitably draw comparisons with “America in the King Years”, a three-volume history by Taylor Branch. But that trilogy was sprawling and expansive—almost 3,000 pages long, and as much about America between 1954 and 1968 as about King. Mr Eig’s is a more traditional biography, and the book benefits from its narrower focus. It gives the reader more insight into the multifaceted man himself.

For though King was a great man, he was not a saint. He plagiarised, philandered, was unkind and sometimes cruel to his wife, and seems to have suffered from what is now recognised as depression. He was also funny, fond of good food and politically shrewd. A doting father, he had a gift for friendship and extraordinary reserves of patience and discipline. Mr Eig makes his courage and moral vision seem all the more exceptional for having come from a man with ordinary flaws.

King was the product of a middle-class upbringing, and of a family ensconced in Atlanta’s black bourgeoisie. His father, affectionately known as “Daddy King”, was strong-willed and stern; he preached at Ebenezer Baptist Church, making it one of the city’s more prominent black churches. King attended Morehouse College, then as now one of America’s best historically black universities, before moving on to seminary in Pennsylvania and graduate school in theology at Boston University.

Now remembered [for his oratory](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/03/28/the-making-of-martin-luther-kings-speeches), as a young seminarian, Mr Eig notes, “he earned As in his philosophy classes and Cs in public speaking.” Mr Eig speculates that some of his northern, white professors “were not enthralled with the black Baptist style”. The high marks in philosophy, however, are unsurprising: King was a student of ideas for his entire life. Written in 1963, his “Letter from Birmingham Jail” is renowned for its moral force and lucid prose. It also bristles with allusions—to the Old and New Testaments, but also Thomas Aquinas, Reinhold Neibuhr, Martin Buber and others. (It did not mention Mohandas Gandhi, whose philosophy of non-violent resistance was perhaps the single greatest influence on King’s life and work.)

He found his voice as a political leader on December 5th 1955, when he was just 26 and a newly installed pastor in Montgomery, Alabama. At Holt Street Baptist Church that evening, four days after the arrest of Rosa Parks for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white passenger, he addressed a crowd of black Alabamans. They were concerned about the response that their boycott of Montgomery’s buses might provoke from the city’s whites.

Mr Eig explains that King “needed to embolden without embittering”. He had to acknowledge his audience’s justified anger yet persuade them to protest righteously and hopefully. Speaking without notes, he advanced a reassuring argument deeply rooted in American and Christian traditions. “We are not wrong,” he declared. “If we are wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, the constitution of the United States is wrong. If we are wrong, God Almighty is wrong.”

## **Like a mighty stream**

They were not wrong—and that may have been the mid-century civil-rights movement’s greatest strength. King’s efforts to overturn legal segregation were at once radical, because African-Americans had been second-class citizens since America’s founding, and based on straightforward American ideals. He understood that the country’s promises of freedom and equality were hollow if geography or skin colour could invalidate them.

Moral suasion was not enough. King also led the most successful pressure campaign in American history, enduring beatings, bombings, imprisonment, scorn, the arms’-length caution of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson’s two-faced truculence, and illegal monitoring and harassment [by the FBI](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/06/08/fbi-files-suggest-mlk-was-more-complicated-than-his-myth). Within a decade of his address in Holt Street, Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. He signed the Fair Housing Act, outlawing discrimination in housing, a week after an assassin’s bullet ended King’s life in 1968.

Yet by the time King died many considered him yesterday’s man. His opposition to the war in Vietnam alienated some of his compatriots. The civil-rights movement had splintered, as more radical voices, such as Stokely Carmichael’s, grew louder. Many white Americans saw ending segregation as the movement’s goal, when, for King, it was just the start: his aim was brotherhood and equality. As the 55 years [since his death](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/04/04/fifty-years-after-martin-luther-kings-death-a-divided-america) have shown, achieving those through policy is fiendishly difficult.

A difficult goal can be worth striving for, however. And it does King and his quest an injustice to suggest he called only for colour-blindness and not, as he put it in 1967, “a reconstruction of the entire society”, perhaps involving the nationalisation of industry and a guaranteed basic income. Such ideas may be discomforting, including for those who would enlist King as an opponent of CRT: always sceptical of “the tranquillising drug of gradualism”, he came to believe that most Americans “are unconscious racists”. But those were still his views, even if expressing them could spell trouble for a teacher in Florida. ■
